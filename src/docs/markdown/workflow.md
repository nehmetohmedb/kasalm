# WorkflowDesigner Component Documentation

This document provides an overview of the WorkflowDesigner components in the CrewAI Manager frontend application.

## Overview

The WorkflowDesigner components form the core of the workflow creation and visualization interface in the CrewAI Manager. This module allows users to visually design agent-based workflows by creating agents, tasks, and connections between them. It leverages ReactFlow for the graph-based visualization and interaction capabilities.

## Data Flow

1. The `WorkflowDesigner` component initializes the state and loads any existing workflow
2. User interactions with the `WorkflowToolbar` trigger actions like adding agents or tasks
3. The `CrewCanvas` and `FlowCanvas` visualize the workflow nodes and edges
4. Dialogs managed by `WorkflowDialogs` allow for detailed configuration of workflow elements
5. Canvas controls enable navigation and visualization adjustments
6. When executing, the workflow state is passed to the execution system

## Key Hooks and Stores

The WorkflowDesigner components utilize several custom hooks and state stores:

- **useWorkflowStore**: Zustand store for workflow state (nodes, edges, UI state)
- **useThemeManager**: Manages dark/light theme
- **useErrorStore**: Handles error state and messages
- **useAgentManager**: Manages agent-related operations
- **useTaskManager**: Manages task-related operations
- **useFlowManager**: Manages flow-specific operations
- **useCrewExecutionStore**: Manages execution state and operations
- **useShortcuts**: Provides keyboard shortcuts with validation logic

## Zustand State Management

The WorkflowDesigner leverages Zustand for efficient state management:

### Core Stores:

1. **Workflow Store (`workflow.ts`)**
   - Manages the state of the workflow editor
   - Tracks nodes, edges, and selection state
   - Handles UI configuration and user preferences
   - Provides actions for manipulating the workflow

2. **Error Store (`error.ts`)**
   - Centralizes error handling
   - Manages error messages and visibility
   - Provides consistent error reporting
   - Used by all components for error management

3. **Crew Execution Store (`crewExecution.ts`)**
   - Manages execution state for crews and flows
   - Tracks job IDs and execution status
   - Provides actions for executing workflows
   - Handles execution errors and notifications

### Store Integration:
- Components access state and actions directly from stores
- Updates are propagated automatically to all subscribers
- Stores persist relevant state to localStorage
- Custom hooks may wrap store functionality for additional logic

## ReactFlow Integration

The WorkflowDesigner leverages ReactFlow for graph visualization with several custom additions:

- **Custom Node Types**: Agent and task node implementations
- **Custom Edge Types**: Animated edges for visualizing connections
- **Custom Controls**: Enhanced control panels
- **State Management**: Integration with application state management
- **Event Handling**: Custom handlers for interactions
- **Validation**: Pre-operation validation for nodes and edges

## Node Operation Validation

The WorkflowDesigner implements comprehensive validation for node operations:

### Crew Execution Validation:
```typescript
const validateCrewExecution = (nodes: Node[]): boolean => {
  const agentNodes = nodes.filter(node => node.type === 'agentNode');
  const taskNodes = nodes.filter(node => node.type === 'taskNode');
  
  if (agentNodes.length === 0 || taskNodes.length === 0) {
    errorStore.setErrorMessage('Crew execution requires at least one agent and one task node');
    return false;
  }
  
  // Check if agent nodes have valid IDs
  const invalidAgents = agentNodes.filter(node => !node.data?.agentId);
  if (invalidAgents.length > 0) {
    errorStore.setErrorMessage('Some agent nodes are missing valid IDs');
    return false;
  }
  
  // Check if task nodes have valid IDs
  const invalidTasks = taskNodes.filter(node => !node.data?.taskId);
  if (invalidTasks.length > 0) {
    errorStore.setErrorMessage('Some task nodes are missing valid IDs');
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
};
```

### Agent Operations Validation:
```typescript
const validateAgentNodes = (nodes: Node[]): boolean => {
  const agentNodes = nodes.filter(node => node.type === 'agentNode');
  
  if (agentNodes.length === 0) {
    errorStore.setErrorMessage('This operation requires at least one agent node');
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
};
```

### Connection Generation Validation:
```typescript
if (agentNodes.length === 0 || taskNodes.length === 0) {
  errorStore.setErrorMessage('You need at least one agent and one task to generate connections');
  return false;
}
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts System

## Best Practices

When working with the WorkflowDesigner components:

1. **State Management**:
   - Use Zustand stores for global state instead of local state
   - Access store actions directly in components
   - Subscribe only to needed state slices for performance
   - Use the error store for all error reporting

2. **Validation**:
   - Always validate node conditions before operations
   - Provide clear error messages for validation failures
   - Use try/catch blocks for error handling
   - Log validation failures for debugging

3. **React Hooks**:
   - Follow the React Hooks rules
   - Use appropriate dependency arrays for useEffect and useMemo
   - Consider useRef for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders
   - Add ESLint comments when necessary for dependency management

4. **Performance**:
   - Memoize expensive calculations and components
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Optimize re-renders by careful state management
   - Monitor React DevTools for performance issues

5. **Component Structure**:
   - Maintain separation of concerns between components
   - Use proper hooks for state management
   - Follow the established patterns for dialog management
   - Leverage the existing validation and error systems
